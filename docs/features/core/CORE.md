# Core Features

## The Actor

The actor is the main entry point for all interactions with the system under test. It represents the user that
interacts with the system. The interactions are performed using task.

An actor is created using the `Actor` class by passing a name and a list of abilities.
The abilities are using libraries and frameworks to send http requests, perform actions on a browser or accessing
information in a database.

```java
import java.lang.annotation.Target;

class Test {

    @Test
    void test() {
        Actor actor = Actor.named("John")
        .whoCan(BrowseTheWeb.with(CLIENT));

      actor.attemptsTo(
          Navigate.to("www.google.com"),
          Enter.text("thekla4j"),into(SearchField),
          Click.on(SearchButton),
          See.ifThe(Text.of(SearchResult))
             .is(Expected.to.be.equal("thekla4j")));
    }
}

```

### Actor Methods

To execute tasks, the actor has the following methods:

| Method                                                                 | Description                                                                       |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `named( String name )`                                                 | Sets the abilities for the actor.                                                 |

| `whoCan( Ability... abilities )`                                       | Sets the abilities for the actor.                                                 |

| `attemptsTo_(Task... tasks)`                                           | Returns a `Function<I,O>` accepting a parameter which is passed to the first task |
| `attemptsTo$(Task... tasks, String stepName, String stepDescription)`  | Executes the given tasks in order and logs the step.                              |
| `attemptsTo$_(Task... tasks, String stepName, String stepDescription)` | Returns a `Function<I,O>` accepting a parameter which is passed to the first task |

## Performer Decorator

The `Performer` decorator extends the functionality of the `Actor` class by allowing it to perform activities and handle
`ActivityError` exceptions.
With the `Performer` decorator, the user dont have to handle The `Either<ActivityError, O>` result of the attemptsTo
method.

This decorator provides methods to execute multiple activities in sequence, with each method returning the result of the
final activity or throwing an `ActivityError` in case of failure.

### Performer Methods

The `Performer` interface provides the following methods:

### Example Usage

```java
class Test {
 
    @Test
    void test() {
        Actor actor = Actor.named("John")
        .whoCan(BrowseTheWeb.with(CLIENT));
        
        Performer performer = Performer.of(actor);
        
        try{
        
        String result = performer.attemptsTo(
            Navigate.to("www.google.com"),
            Enter.text("thekla4j").into(SearchField),
            Click.on(SearchButton),
            See.ifThe(Text.of(SearchResult)).is(Expected.to.equal("thekla4j"))
        );
        
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        
        } catch (ActivityError e){
          e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## Creating Custom Tasks

In the thekla4j framework, tasks are the fundamental units of work that an Actor can perform.
There are different types of tasks, each serving a specific purpose.
Below is a description of the different task types and a guide on how to create custom tasks.

### Task Types

To create a custom task, you have the possibility to .

#### Task

A Task represents a unit of work that an Actor can perform. It can have input parameters and return a result.
Example: Authorize to a backend and returning the token.

````java
public class Authorize implements Task<User, String> {
    private final String url;
  
    public Authorize(String url) {
        this.url = url;
    }

    @Override
    public Either<ActivityError, String> performAs(Actor actor) {
        // Perform the authorization task by sending one or multiple requests to the backend
        return Either.right("token");
    }

    public static Authorize toBackend(String url) {
        return new Authorize(url);
    }
}
````

#### BasicInteraction
A BasicInteraction is a simple task that performs an action without returning a result.
Example: a sequence of activities on a UI

```java
class UploadAFile implements BasicInteraction {
    private final String filePath;
  
    public UploadAFile(String filePath) {
        this.filePath = filePath;
    }

    @Override
    public Either<ActivityError, Void> performAs(Actor actor) {
        // Perform the upload task by clicking on the upload button and selecting the file
      return actor.atttemptsTo(
          Click.on(UploadButton),
          Enter.theValue(filePath).into(UploadField)
      );
    }

    public static UploadAFile from(String filePath) {
        return new UploadAFile(filePath);
    }
}
```

#### ConsumerTask
A ConsumerTask is a task that consumes an input and performs an action without returning a result.
Example: Logging a message, updating a database record.


#### SupplierTask
A SupplierTask is a task that supplies a result without requiring any input.
Example: Generating a random number, fetching the current date and time.
